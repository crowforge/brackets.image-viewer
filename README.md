Brackets Image Viewer (OSX only)
=====================

Brackets extension for viewing images instead of 
showing up the error modal.

Todo:
* open in the editor instead of the modal window
* make it work on both Windows and OSX
* make the context menu work on OSX (hopefully)
* (alternatively) add "delete" and "show in OS" buttons for OSX (if possible)
